Hello! My name is SUN Cho Fei (Pascal). I am currently pursuing MPhil in Statistics under the supervision of [Professor YAU Chun Yip](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/cyyau/). My research interests focus on Extreme Value Theory, Environmental Statistics and Time Series Analysis.

Before joinning Professor YAU's team, I received my BSc in Risk Management Science from CUHK (The Chinese University of Hong Kong) with First Class Honours.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, hiking as well as exploring different cities around the world.
